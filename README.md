This project of ours is basically an Agentic RAG

Agentic RAG stands for Retrieval - Augmented Generation(RAG) which is an advanced form where The Large Language Models doesnt just retrieve and summarizes the documents it behaves like an agent that can take multiple reasoning steps , make decisions and interact with tools or APIs to get better answers.

RAG = Retrieval + Generation
User asks a question or uploads an supporting documentfrom which the system retrieves knowledge based data. The LLM uses the retrieved context and its own knowledge to generate an answer.

It too has some limitations like only single pass, no decision- making , can fail if retrieved docs are incomplete or ambiguous.

Our this project is based on generation of the carrier path and gives advices based on the user input by using rag-pipelining.
